Then flush the nat and mangle tables, flush all chains (-F), and delete all non-default chains (-X):

Also change in /etc/sysctl.conf

What is and how do I enable IP forwarding on Linux?
IP forwarding is the ability for an operating system to accept incoming network packets on one interface, recognize that it is not meant for the system itself, but that it should be passed on to another network, and then forwards it accordingly. This is what you need when you have for example a system setup that is sitting between two different networks and needs to pass traffic between them. On pretty much any Linux system, barring a few exceptions, this can be accomplished by editing the /etc/sysctl.conf file and adding or uncommenting a specific line. To enable IP forwarding on Ubuntu/Debian for example you can do this:
Open the file /etc/sysctl.conf in the nano text editor:
nano /etc/sysctl.conf
Uncomment or add this line:
net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
Press ctrl+x, then press y, and then press enter, to save and exit the file. Next run this command:
sysctl -p

Arithematic Operations
Must have spaces in between
1. expr
expr 6 + 5
expr 6 - 5
expr $a / $b
expr 2 \* 5     must escape multiply

2. double parenthesis
No need of $ before variable and no spacing issues and no escape for * and only decimal outputs
echo $(( a+b ))
echo $(( a-b ))
echo $(( a/b ))
echo $(( a*b ))
echo $((A++))
echo $((++A))
echo $((A--))
echo $((--A))

3. bc : basic calculator
echo $a/$b |bc -l
-l for floating point result


Condition
if [ $rocket = "failed" ]
then
echo "failed"
elif [ $rocket = "success" ]
then
echo "else if"
fi


Coditions
[ string1 = string2 ]   spaces around brackets and = and for strings only
[ string1 != string2 ]

For numeric values

[ 5 -eq 5 ]
[ 5 -ne 5 ]
[ 6 -gt 5 ]
[ 5 -lt 7 ]


Double square brackets : only supported in bash
[[ string1 = string2 ]]

if specifying patterns do not put them in double quotes
[[ "abcd" = *bc* ]] check if bc is in strig1
[[ "abd" = ab[cd] ]] third character can be c or d
[[ "abc" > "bcd" ]] : False
[[ "abc" < "bcd" ]] : True

Operators && ||

for single square brackets
[ cond1 ] && [ cond2 ]
[ cond1 ] || [ cond2 ]
for doubel square brackets
[[ cond1 && cond2 ]]
[[ cond1 || cond2 ]]

[[ A -gt 4 && A -lt 10 ]] A is between 4 and 10
[[ A -gt 10 || A -lt 4 ]] A is greater then 10 or less 4

File level operators

[ -e FILE ] : if file exists
[ -d FILE ] : if file exists and is a directory
[ -s FILE ] : if file exists and has size greater than 0
